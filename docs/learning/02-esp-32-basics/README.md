## 1. Simple light up light on the board


I ran this platformio setup when starting with WROOM:
https://gyazo.com/37ea603742f484d6cf2d05bb1ba84736



When I ran the code, I got this error msg:
```text
A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: Invalid head of packet (0x00): Possible serial noise or corruption.
For troubleshooting steps visit: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/troubleshooting.html
*** [upload] Error 2
============================================================================================================ [FAILED] Took XX.XX seconds ============================================================================================================

 *  The terminal process "C:\Users\user\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe 'run', '--target', 'upload'" terminated with exit code: 1. 
 *  Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it. 
```

When running the code
And to run esp32 make sure you have the drivers to run it, as I saw that I dont.

It needs driver, on the chip it says CP2102


Image esp32-2.jpg here.


So we can find them here:
https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads

I have windows so I downloaded that. And now we see it (Above before, below After)

And now it blinks
-> Video how it blinks.


## 2. Button was pressed Print

When button is pressed in Terminal I get a

"
The button is released
The button is pressed
"


Was looking at this:
https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-button

And read some stuff with chatgpt/gemini/claude/grok etc... anything works

To clearly learn the code, I did this with chatgpt:
Quiz me on it with 7 different quesitons,once I answer judge me honestly and provide feedback to my answer and give me a score from 0-10


So that I dont only read the code, but fully understand whats going on. Really recommend it.
Like this:
https://gyazo.com/3653ac1843193fca82ac2226e312e881


And this quiz really helped me as when pressing button it was returning this weird gibbersihs, as I had it at 9600 as from arduino but for esp32 they talk faster so you need it at 115200 which is basicly a lot faster communication.


## 3. Turn on a led with button press.

Same thing, these guys are awesome:
https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-button-led

+ chatgpt with 7 quiz questions.


This is harder than I thought for some reason cannot make it work.


But yea, made it work now. Here it how it looks.


So now Quized myself again, this the prompt I usually use.

"
Everything we dicusssed right now from the circuit to the code to light up the led using a button.
Explain everything and then quiz me with 10 questions.

Judge each question as a critical teacher and at the end provide me a great from 1-10.
"

Again, I do this too keep the things I learn in my head or else I fucking just fucking phase out.

## 4. Turn on same LED but using the Web

You have to find your SSID here (on Windows):
https://gyazo.com/1110d44d83ae12785252bd3f034dedcc

And add the password (make sure you dont share these and have it as a local )

And now you should be able ot turn on / off led by pressing the button:
https://gyazo.com/b12efbcb9b813e89330eb06d994ae163

And it will turn and off the LED on the ESP32 (the built in one)

Also added .env file where you can add your wifi log and pw, so that its never pushed, just copy hte env.example and remove the example part.


So now yea, it should look something like this:


Turn on/Off led, via wifi, this is prettry awesome.


So now in the browser you can go do:
http://192.168.2.79/led/off
http://192.168.2.79/led/on 


To do it (just check which ip you have, it might be different.)

And it should turn on/off the built in led on the esp32.

To make it feel even cooler, power it with a power bank or something, not connected to the pc, so you really feel the internet thing working.
Example here:
